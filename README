Pull configs from bitbucket and sync all to all devices including p182, itxs8, 15r, and termux

First update recursively all submodules, which includes the vim plugins and their submodules pointing to the 'correct' ref that has been committed. Note: that this is run every time we run the syncy2kconfigs.sh script:

    [y2k@15r syncy2kconfigs]
    $ git submodule update --recursive

Then update all of my personal repos to the latest that has been pushed to my bitbucket remotes:

    [y2k@15r syncy2kconfigs]
    $ git submodule update --remote

Finally, pull the newest versions of vim plugins from the remotes:

    [y2k@15r syncy2kconfigs]
    $ cd vim_config && git submodule update --remote

Then you can go go through git status and see what remote updates need rebased/merged/committed.

To add nvim plugins:

    $ cd ~/devel/syncy2kconfigs/vim_config/bundle
    $ git submodule add https://github.com/Shougo/deoplete.nvim.git
